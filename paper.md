# Introduction
There's some hella biomass burning aerosols in W.Africa. It aint godly.
Steve Buscemi (born 1957) conducted several studies in this region but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.
A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional level
